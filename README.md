Python Object-Oriented Programming Lab
This project is an implementation of a Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab designed to apply OOP principles in a structured and realistic scenario.

The system is built around four main classes: Person, Employee, Car, and Office, each with clearly defined responsibilities. The project demonstrates practical usage of:

Inheritance between Person and Employee

Encapsulation using properties and protected attributes

Class variables and class methods to manage shared data across offices

Static methods for utility calculations

Interaction between objects following proper responsibility separation

The application simulates an office environment where employees can work, drive cars, refuel, send emails, and be managed by offices through hiring, firing, rewarding, deducting salaries, and checking lateness based on distance and velocity.

This project focuses on clean design, correct object interactions, and adherence to object-oriented programming best practices as specified in the lab requirements.
